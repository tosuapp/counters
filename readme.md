# How to create pp counter

To start creating pp counters you need to download `VS Code` (or other IDE), [tosu](https://github.com/KotRikD/tosu/releases) or [gosu](https://github.com/l3lackShark/gosumemory/releases) and `quickstart example`.

Then you need a little bit knowledge about css, html, javascript (or you can just google or ChatGPT most of stuff).

    3. Download [tosu](https://github.com/KotRikD/tosu/releases) or [gosu](https://github.com/l3lackShark/gosumemory/releases)
